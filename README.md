 I am studying and improving myself in the Node.js ecosystem. I have a general knowledge in front-end with React, but my focus is the Backend development with Nodejs, mainly the development of REST API's using the main and most modern Node frameworks and libraries. I also have knowledge in SQL database (PostgreSQL and MySQL) and basic knowledge in non-relational database with MongoDB. I am constantly looking for knowledge to improve my skills and learn new things to become a good technology professional.
  
Formation: Technical course in Systems Development by ETEC.
